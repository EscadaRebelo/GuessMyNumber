# Guess my number ❔

## Description

A game where users insert a number between 1 and 100, and the app will then randomly guess a number and ask the user,
if the number he/him inserted is higher or lower then the one the app generated.
At each iteration the user indicates whether their number is higher or lower until the app guesses the same.
If users lie about their number beeing higher or lower than the one the app guessed, it shows a error message, telling them not to lie and they can procced with beeing honest.
After guessing the users number, it will show how many rounds/iterations it took to guess it.
